%\begin{abstract}
\noindent The Nugrid-Python-Chemical-Evolution Environment, short NuPyCEE, provides
a framework to simulate the ejecta of simple stellar populations with the 1-zone code
Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications as well as galaxies
with the One-zone Model for the Evolution of Galaxies.
Various chemical evolution input parameters can be specified through a python-based interface.
Both tools provide extraction and plotting methods.
We also provide a web interface with limited capabilities which allows to download
yield tables containing the ejecta of SSPs. 
To compare the results to observational data, the user can utilize the STELLAB module
which provides various spectroscopic abundance ratios of stars observed in the 
Milky Way and local dwarf spheroidal galaxies.

\section{Introduction}
\index{\ndocname}
Welcome to the \ndocname\ user Guide. The purpose of \ndocname\ is to 
provide the user with a framework to perform chemical evolution calculations.
The focus lies on simplification and user-friendliness.
The user can choose between the \textit{Stellar Yields for Galactic Modeling Applications} (SYGMA) module 
and the \textit{One-zone Model for the Evolution of Galaxies} (OMEGA) module.
SYGMA allows to follow the ejecta of simple stellar populations in a closed box while OMEGA deals with
the simulation of galaxies with inflows and outflows.
Both tools can be used in a similar manner through the ipython command line or
ipython notebooks.
%However included are low-mass, intermediate and massive star contributions, including
%SN2 and SN1a.

%This section will provide the user with a 
%tutorial and walk through of the tools contained within \ndocname\ and
%how a typical user would go about using and working with this python module.
%Note also that each SYGMA version provides a python-based function documentation (Sphinx) 
%in Sphinx\textunderscore DOC which can be accessed with the web brower through build/html/index.hmtl.

\subsection{Fastest possible instruction}

To download the code
you need to have git installed on your local machine.
Then download the code from github at

\url{https://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE}

into your local directory via

\begin{verbatim}
git clone  https://github.com/NuGrid/NuPyCEE.git .
\end{verbatim}

Install ipython with numpy and matplotlib and
nugridpy via

\begin{verbatim}
pip install nugridpy
\end{verbatim}

Start ipython in the NuPyCEE directory with

\begin{verbatim}
ipython -pylab -p numpy
\end{verbatim}

To run a SYGMA calculation:

\begin{verbatim}
import sygma as s
s1=s.sygma()
\end{verbatim}

That's it! To plot the total  mass ejected:

\begin{verbatim}
s1.plot_totmasses(source='all')	
\end{verbatim}

%More plot functions are available: s1.plot$<$tab$>$.
%Use a question mark after the plotting function
%for more infos.

To run OMEGA:

\begin{verbatim}
import omega as o
o1=o.omega()
\end{verbatim}

\begin{verbatim}
o1.plot_spectro(xaxis='[Fe/H]',yaxis='[O/Fe]')
\end{verbatim}

Now you might want to compare the prediction with
observations through the STELLAB module.

\begin{verbatim}
import stellab as st
st1=st.stellab()
st1.plot_spectro(xaxis='[Fe/H]', yaxis='[O/Fe]')
\end{verbatim}




%Check out the documentation in Section \ref{sect_omega}. 

\subsection{Preparing the environment}%Tutorial and Walkthough}

To take advantage of the interactive ipython environment 
SYGMA and OMEGA are both launched after starting
ipython with


\begin{verbatim}
ipython -pylab -p numpy
\end{verbatim}

where the modules numpy and matploblib have to be installed.
Also you might need to install other python modules (e.g., h5py).

A necessary dependence is NuGrid's pylib toolbox nugridpy which
contains a number of python scripts.  It can simply be installed via
pip:

\begin{verbatim}
pip install nugridpy
\end{verbatim}


%Make sure your PYTHONPATH variable is pointing to this directory.

\subsection{SYGMA}

\subsubsection{General concepts}

In order to follow the chemical enrichment via gas particles
in hydrodynamical simulations one has to describe the ejecta of material
from such star particles, essentially simple stellar populations. 
With SYGMA one can follow the ejecta of such populations via
diagrams and you can extract the composition of the ejecta via tables.


\subsubsection{Getting started}

If one wants to start SYGMA from outside the SYGMA directory
one has to specify the $SYGMADIR$ variable which
points to the SYGMA dir.

Import the module:

\begin{verbatim}
import sygma as s
\end{verbatim}

Next, we create an SSP instance, initiate a class instance $s1$ of SYGMA:


\begin{verbatim}
s1=sygma.sygma(iniZ=0.0001,tend=1e10,mgal=1e9)
\end{verbatim}

A single stellar population of mass $1\times10^{9}\msun$ and metal fraction
of $0.0001$ is created and evolved in time steps of $10^{8}$ years
to the final time of 1e10 years. Other not specified and hence
default parameter include for example the choice of the initial-mass function.
%range of $1\msun$ up to $30\msun$ is used. NuGrid tables 
%and SN1a yields from Thielemann86 are taken


One can check the definition of these input parameter online via
\url{http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE/SPHINX/build/html/sygma.html}.


No yield tables are defined and hence the NuGrid tables as the
default choice were selected. These are the Set1 and Set1extension
yields which are
%\begin{verbatim}
%s1=sygma.sygma(alphaimf=2.35,sfr='input',iniZ=0.0001,dt=1e8,tend=1e10,mgal=1e9,
% table='yield_tables/isotope_yield_table.txt',
% sn1a_table='yield_tables/sn1a_t86.txt',
% bb_table='yield_tables/bb_walker91.txt')
%\end{verbatim} 
AGB and massive star yields for five different metallicities.
In this mode the user specifies $iniZ$
which can be either $Z=2e-2, 1e-2, 6e-3, 1e-3, 1e-4$ and $0.0$.
Scaled abundances for Z=1e-t65, 1e-6 will be available soon.
Currently for $Z=0$ the PopIII stars from Heger et al. (2010) are set
as default.

\subsubsection{Providing your own yield tables}

Yield tables are available in the NuPyCEE subdirectory 
yield\textunderscore tables. Add your yield tables to
this directory and SYGMA will be able read the table
if you have specified the $table$ variable. Only
for table of Z=0 the variable $pop3\textunderscore table$ is used.
Both tables need yields specified in the SYGMA (and OMEGA)
yield input format. See for the structure the default table.
It is important to provide an initial abundance
file which has to match the number of species provided in the yield tables.
Provide the file in the iniAbu directory inside the directory yield\textunderscore tables.
The input variable with which the table file can be specified is $iniabu\textunderscore table$.
For the necessary structure see again the default choice of that variable.
%Another subdirectory,
%plotting\textunderscore scripts, contains various 
%plotting scripts. The latter use SYGMA's plotting functions.


\subsubsection{What do I get out?}


The output during execution shows some initial parameters,
e.g. the isotopes being part of chemical evolution,
as well as the time and metallicity evolution.
Also shown is the contribution time of stars of 
certain initial mass.



%For more examples, see the SYGMA ipython notebooks available
%at \\http://208.75.74.161:8888/tree/Publicnotebooks/intro\textunderscore SYGMA.

To analyze the run afterwards we provide a variety of plotting  functions
which are described in detail at \url{http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE/SPHINX/build/html/sygma.html}.
In following we give some examples. The function plot\textunderscore mass() shows the evolution
of the yield in solar masses.


\begin{verbatim}
s1.plot_mass()
\end{verbatim}

With SYGMA you can look at different contributions
for AGB stars, massive stars, and SN~Ia.

\begin{verbatim}
s1.plot_mass(source='agb')
s1.plot_mass(source='massive')
s1.plot_mass(source='sn1a')

\end{verbatim}

Note that those lines appear all in one figure.
%The solar abundance distribution is taken from GN93 (NuGrid file).

%To get an overview over the available abundance distribution
%(in mass fraction divided by solar mass fraction) of the gas
%reservoir at a certain timestep, a function
%called plot\textunderscore abu\textunderscore distr() is available.
The function $plot\textunderscore mass\textunderscore range\textunderscore contributions()$
shows the yield contribution of stars as a function of their initial mass.
It allows to identify which mass range contributes to certain elements.
%Also plotted is to each yield (grid input) corresponding mass range
%as vertical lines. In these intervals the yields are the same (for one 
%simple stellar population).
To monitor the evolution of the mass of the gas reservoir ejected
masses over time, use plot\textunderscore totmasses().
The star formation rate as a function of time can be plotted with the function $plot\textunderscore sfr()$.
In the case you want to write out detailed chemical evolution tables
of isotopes, use the function $write\textunderscore evol\textunderscore table()$.
It writes out the mass of isotopes ejected by stars as a function of time
(each line represents a timestep).

\subsection{OMEGA}

\subsubsection{General concepts}
OMEGA is a classical one-zone, open-box galaxy model with
an input star formation history where stars form and inject new elements within
the same gas reservoir, using SYGMA to create a SSP at every timestep.
At any time, each existing SSP ejects material that reflects its age, mass, and initial metallicity.
OMEGA can mimic known local galaxies, such as Sculptor, Carina, and Fornax,
by using the observed star formation history and current mass, which is taken
from the literature.  It also offers the possibility to mimic the Milky Way, but we
warn the user that a one-zone model is probably too simplistic to simulate the
evolution of massive and complex galaxies, although they are useful for testing
stellar yields.

The code offers three different prescriptions for treating gas inflows and outflows
(see the OMEGA Userguide ipython notebook on WENDI, \url{http://www.nugridstars.org/projects/wendi}).  
Inflows and outflows can be independently switched off to consider a semi-open box or a closed box model.
The different prescriptions can also be found in C\^ot\'e et al. (2016, \url{http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016arXiv160407824C}).

A complete description of OMEGA's input parameters and functions can
be found in the Sphinx documentation (\url{http://nugrid.github.io/NuPyCEE/SPHINX/build/html/omega.html}). 
All the SSP parameters associated with SYGMA are available with OMEGA as well.

\subsubsection{Getting Started with OMEGA}

We refer to the OMEGA Userguide ipython notebook on WENDI (\url{http://www.nugridstars.org/projects/wendi})
for more information about how to use OMEGA with command lines, and how to use plotting functions
to analyze the predicted chemical evolution of the target galaxy.


\subsection{STELLAB}

STELLAB (short for Stellar Abundances) is a module that allows to plot the stellar abundances 
observed in different galaxies.  So far, data are available for the Milky Way, Sculptor, Fornax, Carina,
and the LMC.  This code uses an input collection of data and plots any abundance ratio [X/Y] as 
a function of another one.  It also offers the possibility to re-normalize all data to the same solar
normalization.  It is a useful and complementary tool that enables to confront numerical predictions
with observations.

We refer to the STELLAB Userguide ipython notebook on WENDI (\url{http://www.nugridstars.org/projects/wendi})
for more information on its usage, options, and collection of data.  It should be noted that observational
data have not been curated, but have rather been blindly taken from the literature.  We are currently
working on a curation process in collaboration with JINA-CEE members (\url{http://www.jinaweb.org}).
